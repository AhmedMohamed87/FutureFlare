            <p class="Pword"> Microsoft Word allows you to effortlessly create simple word-processing documents like
                letters and reports, allowing you to add color and clip art. Writing in various fonts and sizes and
                using tables, borders & bullet formatting reduces tediousness and increases productivity</p>

            PowerPoint allows you to use images, audio and video to have a greater visual impact. These visual and audio
            cues may also help a presenter be more improvisational and interactive with the audience. However, try not
            to overly rely on these sources as your message might get lost in the clutter</p>
