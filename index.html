                    elected officials. The law is expansive with many different fields. It is used to resolve contract
                    disputes, property disputes, and other private conflicts. In the business world, organizations rely
                    on legal experts to guide them through complex legal processes, from taxation to mergers. And
                    criminal law holds individuals and organizations accountable for engaging in crimes, while serving
                    justice to those who have been victimized.</p>
